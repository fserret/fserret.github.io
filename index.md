# Welcome!
<br>

Hi! I am **Dr. Michel Fabrice Serret**, currently a **post‑doctoral fellow** at the Paul Scherrer Institute in the Laboratory for Simulation and Modelling. At PSI, I am working in the [**High Performance Numerical Algorithms and Simulations**](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/high-performance-numerical-algorithms-and-simulations) group, an interinstitutional group between PSI and EPFL headed by Laura Grigori.

My current research focuses on improving the computational efficiency of **language models** and more specifically in using **tensor-based** methods and **randomization** techniques to improve the performance and memory-cost of **attention-based Neural Network** models.

My areas of expertise also include **quantum computing** and **differential equations** which were the subjects of my thesis in which I worked on determining the computational complexity for solving differential equations using **variational quantum algorithms** in the presence of **quantum noise**.
